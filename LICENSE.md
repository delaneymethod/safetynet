This is a single-installation license, meaning you may integrate a Licensed Copy into one public-facing (“Internet”) or internal (“intranet”) web root directory at a time (the “Website”). You may also install and use DelaneyMethod CMS without limitation for local development and testing purposes.

### 4. License Agreement Validity

This license is valid only if the Website is a work that uses DelaneyMethod CMS, and does not compete with DelaneyMethod CMS.

### 5. Installation and Usage

You may install and use DelaneyMethod CMS only in the nature that is described in DelaneyMethod CMS’s <a href="https://www.delaneymethod.com/cms/docs" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

You may not make any alterations to DelaneyMethod CMS’s code or the database tables/columns put in place by DelaneyMethod CMS, unless instructed to do so by DelaneyMethod. If you have a need that is not addressed via DelaneyMethod CMS’s core feature set, and you lack the means to write a plugin to fill the need yourself, please contact <a href="mailto:hello@delaneymethod.com">hello@delaneymethod.com</a>.

### 6. Updates

DelaneyMethod will provide you with free updates to the edition of DelaneyMethod CMS applicable to your Licensed Copy for the remainder of DelaneyMethod CMS’s lifespan.
